## Project info
#### Front-end challenge (patients dashboard)

#### The app shows a dashboard displaying a list of patients, all of which can be filtered by medical status, or searched through an input by its name/lastname. Also each row can be clicked to be redirected to the patient's details page, displaying personal information and an expenses list. Expenses can be added and deleted (multiple records). Both expenses and patients are mocked and hardcoded, no API is consumed.
